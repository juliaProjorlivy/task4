Our bored Yevgeny’s place of leisure

Was in fact a fine estate,

Where lovers of life’s simple pleasure

Would thank the heavens for their fate.

The manor house was quite secluded,

Screened by the hills when storms intruded,

Beside a river. On every side,

Stretched the pastures far and wide,

Golden cornfields, flowery meadows,

Here a village, there another,

Cattle grazing in the clover,

Parkland, overgrown, soft shadows

Deepening the garden’s shade,

Where the pensive dryads played.
