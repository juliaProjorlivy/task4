The stately pile was nobly planned

As such fine mansions ought to be,

Firmly founded on the land,

With all the taste we used to see.

Every salon high and handsome,

Damask in the drawing-room,

Ancestral portraits stretched for miles,

Stoves shone with ceramic tiles.

All this is out of fashion now,

Though why it is, who can say,

Yet none of it, the whole display

Moved our hero, Iâ€™ll allow,

An ancient house or one new-born

Both of them would make him yawn.

An ancient house or one new-born
